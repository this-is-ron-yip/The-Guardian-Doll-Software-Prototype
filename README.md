Heyy Oscar Davis!! Welcome to the Project!! I have setup the basic structure of the project and we can just start working on our respective function! One point to note is that the how to pick up the audio is still unresolved. probably the one handling the text-speech conversion can also see how we can pick up that audio! (eg. pressing the space bar idk haha) also for better development purpose, if you have to push unfinished code, please start a new branch!! it would be better to not push the code to main branch until it is completed!! Gayao and have fun (probably)!!

# Welcome to the project
People with intellectual disabilities may face challenges in expressing themselves effectively, and individuals with malicious intentions might take advantage of these characteristics. In the Cambridge nursing home (康橋之家) incident, Cheung Kin Wa, the director of the disability nursing home, harassed intellectually disabled residents of the nursing home, as they are incapable of speaking out for themselves. This situation is undeniably tragic, and proving his guilt is not easy due to the residents' inability to express themselves because of their disabilities, which have been exacerbated by the harassment they experienced. It is hoped that more protection can be provided to these individuals, and this product aims to address the aforementioned issue.

In this project, we aim to develop a toy doll that is equipped with a microphone and speaker, integrated with a GenAI ChatBot that offers the following features:

- Emotional supporting function
  - Basic conversation function (completed): to act as a companion for the user.

- Patient protecting function
  - SOS feature (completed): automatically detecting potential threats (e.g., suicidal thoughts/bullying/harassment) and alerting parents/professionals in critical situations.
  - Message recording function (completed): to safeguard the user by providing evidence in case of any incidents.
  - Indirect communication feature (completed): facilitating communication between the user and a psychologist through an alternative channel.
  - GPS locating function: to prevent the patient from getting lost.

- Therapy assistant function
  - Emotion recording function: monitor patients’ emotional changes daily (through textual content/tone/facial expressions) and provide statistical information for psychiatrists to monitor patients’ condition.
  - Triggering Topics Identification: study and identify words and topics that would trigger their emotions through daily conversations (i.e., what they like/hate).
  - Speech Training Assistant: teaching patients on different topics (e.g., maths/pronunciation).
